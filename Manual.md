## Introduction
This user manual provides insights into my work style, preferences, and communication style to help us collaborate effectively. 

> *"Do or do not. There is no try."* – <u>Yoda.</u>

## Work Style
- **Environment**: I thrive in a personalized workspace with minimal distractions. Ideally, I would have a quiet corner with multiple monitors (including an ultrawide) and the ability to surround myself with some plants and personal items.
- **Focus**: I require external stimuli to stay focused, often using music (jazz, classical, etc.) and fidget toys (Rubik's cube, etc.).
- **Learning**: I'm a continuous learner who values documentation, online resources (websites, YouTube channels), and learning from others' experiences, including reading blogs and devlog.
> *"Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself."* - <u>Eleanor Roosevelt.</u>

## Communication
- **Preferred Channels**: Asynchronous communication through Slack/Discord channels works best for me.
- **Feedback**: I appreciate clear rationales with your feedback. I prefer concise messages with discussion points over lengthy reviews. Code reviews with suggestions are also helpful.
- **Meetings**: I enjoy open discussions but with a clearly defined meeting goal at the outset.
>*"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence."* - <u>Albert Einstein.</u>

## Collaboration & Teamwork
- **Input/Feedback**: I'm open to feedback throughout a project but find it particularly valuable during brainstorming phases and before code pushes.
- **Recognition**: I appreciate public recognition for my contributions, but I also value acknowledgment of the less quantifiable aspects of my work.
> *"It's much more difficult to make a judgment on yourself than on anyone else."* - <u>St Exupéry.</u>

- **Meetings**: Mornings are generally suitable for meetings, allowing me to focus on deep work during afternoons and evenings.
- **Personal Commitments**: I may need time for personal commitments like chess tournaments, so please remember this when scheduling.
