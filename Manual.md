## Work Style
- Environment: I thrive in a personalized workspace with minimal distractions. Ideally, I would have a quiet corner with multiple monitors (including an ultrawide) and the ability to surround myself with some plants and personal items.
- Focus: I require external stimuli to stay focused, often using music (jazz, classical, etc.) and fidget toys (Rubik's cube, etc.).
- Learning: I'm a continuous learner who values documentation, online resources (websites, YouTube channels), and learning from others' experiences, including reading blogs and devlog.

## Communication
- Preferred Channels: Asynchronous communication through Slack/Discord channels works best for me.
- Feedback: I appreciate clear rationales with your feedback. I prefer concise messages with discussion points over lengthy reviews. Code reviews with suggestions are also helpful.
- Meetings: I enjoy open discussions but with a clearly defined meeting goal at the outset.

## Collaboration & Teamwork
